-----Complete CI process with Jenkins and some tools------

+ SonarQube: analysis of code to detect bugs and code smells on 29 programming language.
+ Jenkins: continous integration/continous delivery automation software Devops written in Java
+ Docker: open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
+ Kubernetes: open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
+DockerHub: is the world's largestlibrary and community for container images.

Prequesites:
+ Install docker and minikube in Local Machine.
+ Containerized Jenkins Image and SonarQubeScanner.
+ Clone this Repo in your Local Machine.
+ Integration Jenkins with Docker.
+ Install Docker and Maven tools for build to Docker Hub .
+ Dowload kubectl for kubernetes command line.

Proceeding:
1.Continuous Integration and deploy images in Dockerhub.
- Open your jenkins web (http://localhost:8081 in my case normally is http://localhost:8080)
  
- Make Credentials for Jenkins Pipeline:
  +  In jenkins Dashboard ->> Manage Jenkins ->> Security ->> Credentials:
  +  Click to Add Credentials and add your Credentials of dockerhub account and GitHub account
     in my case are new_git_Cre(GitHub Credentials) and dockerhub_Cre_new(dockerhub Credentials)   
  +  Then in Jenkinsfile you change the credentialsId of GitHub and Dockerregistry.
    
- Create a new Jobs and use Pipeline item
  + Scroll down to Pipeline. You have two options
                              -Pipeline Script (Copy Jenkinsfile in your updated repo in this space)
                              -Pipeline Script from SCM(If you have GitHub account and Push your code in this)
    
- Then Click ->> Apply ->> Save

-Finished you can build project now

2.Deploy application in k8s locally

- Command(To boostrapp Kubernetes cluster in Minikube):
  
        minikube start

- And Turn on the terminal with directory to your project repo:

      cd /Complete_Jenkins_CI

- Check your deployments and pods: 

      kubectl get pods

      kubectl get deploy
  
-And deploy your image from dockerhub:

      docker pull (your_dockerhub_id)/spring_boot_app:6.0

      kubectl apply -f deploymentservice.yaml

-And check your service and API:

      minikube service app-service
