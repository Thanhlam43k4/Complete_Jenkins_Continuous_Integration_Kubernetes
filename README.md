Proceeding:

- Make Credentials for Jenkins Pipeline:
  +  In jenkins Dashboard ->> Manage Jenkins ->> Security ->> Credentials:
  +  Click to Add Credentials and add your Credentials of dockerhub account and GitHub account
     in my case are new_git_Cre(GitHub Credentials) and dockerhub_Cre_new(dockerhub Credentials)   
  +  Then in Jenkinsfile you change the credentialsId of GitHub and Dockerregistry.
- Create a new Jobs and use Pipeline item
